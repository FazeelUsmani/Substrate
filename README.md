# Substrate


This repository contains my learning path towards Substrate

Developer Hub: https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/

I recommend to start from the Fundamentals of Blockchain, Install, Build and then Test. 
There are also tutorials available which helps to work with pallets, connect with other chains,
develop smart contracts and much more. Enjoy the journey!
